# Tradie Leads Marketplace sandbox

As a React engineer, you have been assigned the task of building leads marketplace web app for tradies to claim leads & get jobs. The goal is to create a dashboard where tradies can see & interact with different leads in their area of interests.

To help you get started, a fake REST server has already been set up for you. You are encouraged to investigate and familiarize yourself with how it works. This will allow you to understand the communication mechanism between the chat app and the server.

Happy coding ðŸš€!
