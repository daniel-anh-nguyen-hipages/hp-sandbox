# Tradie Chat App sandbox

As a React engineer, you have been assigned the task of building a chat web app for tradies in the same team to communicate with each other. The goal is to create a platform where tradies can easily exchange messages and collaborate effectively.

To help you get started, a fake socket has already been set up for you. You are encouraged to investigate and familiarize yourself with how it works. This will allow you to understand the communication mechanism between the chat app and the server.

Happy coding ðŸš€!
